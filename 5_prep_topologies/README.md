# Prepare topologies for MD

Here, we will make a topology for the MD/FEP transformation of our ligand A both in water and in the receptor. Note that if you instead want to run an amino acid FEP, rather prepare one apo and on holo structure of the receptor. In that case, add the missing Gromacs waters you got in section 3 of the repository for the apo form (where the ligand normally is..).



## **1. Ligand in water**

- Make a new folder i.e. called top_X (X=name of your compound).

- Go inside and copy the associated "Forcefield" folder you created in section 3 of this repository.
