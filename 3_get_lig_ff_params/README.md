# Get OPLS ligand force field parameters

For each FEP, you will need the force field parameters of both the MD topology's ligand (usually the biggest) and of the one to compare it to.

## **1. Preparing the receptor structure (skip if using option 2 in next section)**

Go to https://opm.phar.umich.edu/ and search for your PDB code of interest and download the equivalent **OPM** PDB file (containing membrane delimiters).
